arrived
on
campus
she
was
assigned
to
a
study
group
carefully
engineered
by
the

to
foster
tight
bonds
study
groups
have
become
a
rite
of
passage
at
programs
a
way
for
students
to
practice
working
in
teams
and
a
reflection
of
the
increasing
demand
for
employees
who
can
adroitly

today
might
start
the
morning
by
collaborating
with
a
team
of
engineers
then
send
emails
to
colleagues
marketing
a
new
brand
then
jump
on
a
conference
call
planning
an
entirely
different
product

while
also
juggling
team
meetings
with
accounting
and
the
partyplanning
committee
to
prepare
students
for
that
complex
world
business

around
the
country
have
revised
their
curriculums
